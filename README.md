Performing analysis on kickstarter excel file
## Overview of Project
    An up-and-coming playwright, Louise, is planning to launch her first crowdfunding campaign to help fund for her play "Fever", budgeted at $10000.
    Prior to kickstarting her project, Louise wants to gain insight on what are the contributing factors that make fundraising in her category successful.
    My role in this project is to use MS Excel to analyze crowdfunding data to uncover funding success factors and report my findings to Louise to get her set up on her path to success.

## Analysis and Challenges
    The focus of the analysis was to uncover any data insights that suggest a higher rate of success on any given factor. 
    Two dimensions of the data were strategically selected for this analysis: funding launch date and crowdfunding amount goal.
    The biggest challenge encountered on this project was the lack of structure in the data, which was overcome by utilizing data modeling techniques such as adding filters, using pivot tables to summarize findings and use of charts and data tables to analyze outcomes under different scenarios.  
 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    For the theater category, the months of May and June yielded the highest success rates in the year. Conversely, the month of November was the month with the largest number of failures.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    The highest success rate for plays is found on fundraising goals totalling less than 1000 (141 total cases or 76% success rate). However, the higher number of success is found on fundraising goals between 1000 and 5000 (388 total cases or 73% success rate).
    
 - What are some limitations of this dataset?
    The dataset fails to provide more specific qualitative information such as city and targeted demographics.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    We could create box and whisker graphs as well as histograms to better assess data distribution and outliers. 
    Additionally, we could create bar or pie charts to understand the size of the different categories within the data set.
